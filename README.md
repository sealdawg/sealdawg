- 👋 Hi, I’m @sealdawg
- 👀 I’m interested in maps, traffic, apis, datasystems and tables.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be most helpful to developers around me
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to geospacial workflows, plaid integrations, POS systems or cool startup ideas in general.
